        Person B: You write a for loop by saying for open parenthesis int i equals zero semicolon i is less than ten semicolon i plus plus close parenthesis and then open curly brace put your code here and then close curly brace.
  
        Person A: What is two plus two?
  
        Person B: Two plus two equals four.
